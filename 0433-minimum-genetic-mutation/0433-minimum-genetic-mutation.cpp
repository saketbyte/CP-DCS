     1) It is simple BFS question.
   
    2) Since we have to find the minimum number of mutations,
    that's why BFS is used.
	
    3) First thing first, I will insert all the valid gene (i.e bank array strings)
    into a unordered set name as dictionary. It helps me to search any particular
    word whether valid or not in O(1) operation.
	
    4) Now, we check whether end word is present in our dictionary or not,
    if end word itself is not in present in the dictioanry then from there
    we return -1, as it will never possible to make end word.
	
    5) Now, for BFS we declare queue, and simply insert start string into queue.
    
    6) We required an anthor set name as visited (vis). vis will carry out whether
    we already encounter this in process curr word to make end string. If yes, then no need
    to insert into queue, but if it is not present in queue, we insert it.
	
    7) Now, for every word, we will try to replace every indicies with available
    choice we have, i.e for every index of curr word we try to replace with 
    'A','C', 'G', & 'T', and will see whether new form word is valid or not.
	
    8) If it is valid we will then go to check vis, if not already visited, 
    we insert into queue and move proceed.
	
    9) For every operation we will increase our answer.
   
    10) Whenever we find our curr word as end word we will return the number of 
    steps taken at that point of time as answer.
	
    11) If still we will not available to make our end word we will return -1,
    as told in the question.
